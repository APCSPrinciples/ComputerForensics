# Computer Forensics Lab
In this lab you will solve three of the computer forensics problems from the NSA sponsored [Toaster Wars high school hacking competition]( (also called a “capture the flag” competition or ctf for short). 
+ [Problem 1 XMLOL](https://2013.picoctf.com/autoproblems/tmpBsOCkD.xml)
+ [Problem 2 NAVSAT](https://2013.picoctf.com/problems/recovery.zip)
+ [Problem 3 Pilot Logic](https://2013.picoctf.com/problems/pilot_image)
The premise of the competition is that a robot from space has crash landed in your backyard. It's up to you and your hacking skills to uncover the secrets he carries.
Download the attached word processing document. Read the instructions for the 3 problems. For each problem, the procedure is the same:
1. Download the file for that problem, but don't double click it
2. Open the file using the HxD program 
3. Look for clues in the data
Have your teacher check your answers.
