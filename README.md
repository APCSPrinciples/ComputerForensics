# Computer Forensics Lab
In this lab you will solve three of the computer forensics problems from the NSA sponsored [Toaster Wars high school hacking competition]( (also called a “capture the flag” competition or ctf for short). 
+ Problem 1 XMLOL: You've discovered a manual for the robot that has instructions on how to dump the corrupted configuration file from the robot's memory. You find a corrupted [XML file](tmpVrg2Ah.xml) and are looking for a configuration key.
+ Problem 2 NAVSAT: Near the Sun, you find a malfunctioning warp beacon which is broadcasting a distress signal in a navigational channel. It looks like it's been damaged by solar radiation, and [some of its data](recovery.zip) have been corrupted. If you can recover it, perhaps it will point at you to something interesting.
+ Problem 3 Pilot Logic: You've gotten a [partial dump of the disk]( from the hangar's machine, and you're pretty sure the pilot's password is cleverly hidden somewhere within it...

The premise of the competition is that a robot from space has crash landed in your backyard. It's up to you and your hacking skills to uncover the secrets he carries.
Download [this word processing document](https://github.com/APCSPrinciples/APCSPrinciples.github.io/blob/master/Worksheets/ComputerForensicsLab1.doc?raw=true). Read the instructions for the 3 problems. For each problem, the procedure is the same:
1. Download the file for that problem, but don't double click it
2. Open the file using the HxD program 
3. Look for clues in the data

Have your teacher check your answers.
